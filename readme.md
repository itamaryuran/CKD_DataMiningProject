Hello and welcome
This project is part of a Data Mining course I take at the open University.
The Project's goal is to classify patients that have Chronic Kidney Disease.
We used a dataset from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Risk+Factor+prediction+of+Chronic+Kidney+Disease - this dataset consists of a 400 rows of data, each of them represents a patient. there are 25 attributes. 24 of them are the independent variables, such as age, blood pressure etc. The last variable, the dipendent variable, is the Class, this one represents weather patient has CKD or not.
In this project I used two methods for classification, CART decision tree, and linear or logistic regression. Both of the methods scored pretty high precisions rates (around 97%).
Please have a look at the project files for more information.  
CKD_Data_Cleaning - is where i proccessed the data at the begining. cleaning and fitting it for work.
DecisionTreeCKD - is where I implemented sklearn's library decisiont tree algorithm
LinearRegression - is where I implemented sklearn's library linear and logistic regression algorithm.
Visualisation - here you can see the code for visualizing the data. mostly by matplotlib.
Enjoy and let me know if you got any comments!
